# Use Case: Multi-Sensor Shared Threshold

Plot multiple sensors on a single tile with one shared threshold, see violation markers for all sensors, and run event detection.

**When to use:** You have several sensors that share the same physical limit (e.g., max temperature across zones, pressure across channels) and want a single threshold line with violations and events computed for each sensor.

## Quick Example

```matlab
setup;

%% Create sensors with identical threshold rules
sensors = cell(1, 4);
names = {'Zone A', 'Zone B', 'Zone C', 'Zone D'};
x = linspace(0, 60, 500000);

for i = 1:4
    s = Sensor(sprintf('zone_%d', i), 'Name', names{i});
    s.X = x;
    s.Y = sin(x * 2 * pi * i / 20) + 0.3 * randn(1, numel(x)) + 3;

    % Same threshold rule for every sensor
    s.addThresholdRule(struct(), 4.5, 'Direction', 'upper', 'Label', 'Max Temp');
    s.resolve();

    sensors{i} = s;
end

%% Plot all sensors on a single tile
fp = FastSense();
for i = 1:numel(sensors)
    % Show threshold line only for the first sensor to avoid duplicates
    fp.addSensor(sensors{i}, 'ShowThresholds', (i == 1));
end
fp.render();
title(fp.hAxes, 'Multi-Sensor — Shared Threshold');
legend(fp.hAxes, 'show');

%% Detect events for all sensors
detector = EventDetector('MinDuration', 0.5);
allEvents = [];
for i = 1:numel(sensors)
    evts = detectEventsFromSensor(sensors{i}, detector);
    if ~isempty(evts)
        allEvents = [allEvents, evts];
    end
end
fprintf('Detected %d events across %d sensors.\n', numel(allEvents), numel(sensors));
```

## How It Works

### 1. Threshold on the Sensor, not just the plot

Each `Sensor` gets the same `ThresholdRule`. When you call `resolve()`, each sensor independently computes:
- **ResolvedThresholds** — the threshold step-function line
- **ResolvedViolations** — the (X, Y) points that exceed the limit

This means every sensor carries its own violation data, which is required for event detection.

### 2. Avoid duplicate threshold lines

When calling `addSensor()`, pass `'ShowThresholds', true` only for the **first** sensor. All subsequent sensors use `'ShowThresholds', false`. This draws the threshold line once while still computing violations for every sensor.

Alternatively, skip `ShowThresholds` entirely and add the threshold manually:

```matlab
for i = 1:numel(sensors)
    fp.addSensor(sensors{i}, 'ShowThresholds', false);
end
fp.addThreshold(4.5, 'Direction', 'upper', 'ShowViolations', true, ...
    'Label', 'Max Temp', 'Color', 'r');
```

This approach draws a single shared threshold line and FastSense computes violation markers against **all lines** on the tile during rendering (see `updateViolations` in FastSense.m).

### 3. Event detection works per-sensor

`detectEventsFromSensor()` reads each sensor's `ResolvedViolations` and groups consecutive violation points into `Event` objects. Since each sensor resolved independently, events are attributed to the correct sensor:

```matlab
% Each event knows which sensor it came from
for i = 1:numel(allEvents)
    fprintf('  %s: %.1fs – %.1fs (peak %.2f)\n', ...
        allEvents(i).SensorName, ...
        allEvents(i).StartTime, allEvents(i).EndTime, ...
        allEvents(i).PeakValue);
end
```

## With State-Dependent Thresholds

The shared threshold can also be state-dependent. Attach the same `StateChannel` and conditional `ThresholdRule` to each sensor:

```matlab
for i = 1:numel(sensors)
    sc = StateChannel('mode');
    sc.setData(modeX, modeValues);   % same state for all
    sensors{i}.addStateChannel(sc);

    % Threshold only active during 'run' mode
    sensors{i}.addThresholdRule(struct('mode', 'run'), 4.5, ...
        'Direction', 'upper', 'Label', 'Run HI');
    sensors{i}.resolve();
end
```

---

## With EventViewer

Display all events in the Gantt-style EventViewer:

```matlab
viewer = EventViewer(allEvents);
```

Each event row shows the sensor name, threshold label, and time span. Click any event to drill down into the data.

## Key Points

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Threshold line** | Drawn once (first sensor or manual `addThreshold`) |
| **Violation markers** | Computed for every line on the tile |
| **Event detection** | Per-sensor via `detectEventsFromSensor()` — requires `resolve()` on each sensor |
| **State-dependent thresholds** | Supported — attach identical `StateChannel` + `ThresholdRule` to each sensor |
| **EventViewer** | Shows events from all sensors, attributed by name |
