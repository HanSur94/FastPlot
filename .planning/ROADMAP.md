# Roadmap: FastSense Advanced Dashboard

## Overview

This milestone extends the existing FastSense dashboard engine with three major capabilities: nested layout organization (collapsible sections and multi-page navigation), per-widget info tooltips, and detachable live-mirrored widgets. Infrastructure hardening runs first to fix known timer and serializer bugs that would otherwise destabilize later phases. The work then proceeds through self-contained feature deliveries before a final serialization and compatibility verification pass.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Infrastructure Hardening** - Fix timer safety, GroupWidget .m export bug, jsondecode normalization, and validate backward compatibility (completed 2026-04-01)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Collapsible Sections** - Wire grid reflow into GroupWidget collapse/expand so collapsing reclaims screen space
- [x] **Phase 3: Widget Info Tooltips** - Add info icon and click-driven description popup to all widget header chrome (completed 2026-04-01)
- [x] **Phase 4: Multi-Page Navigation** - Add DashboardPage container, PageBar UI, and page-switching with active-page persistence (completed 2026-04-01)
- [x] **Phase 5: Detachable Widgets** - Detach button on every widget; DetachedMirror class; live sync via shared timer (completed 2026-04-02)
- [x] **Phase 6: Serialization & Persistence** - Verify and harden round-trip correctness for all new structures across JSON and .m formats (completed 2026-04-02)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Hardening
**Goal**: The dashboard engine is safe to extend — timer errors cannot silently kill refresh, GroupWidget children survive .m export, and jsondecode normalization is applied wherever nested arrays are decoded
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, COMPAT-01, COMPAT-02, COMPAT-03, COMPAT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When an error occurs inside the live timer tick, the timer continues running and the error is logged (does not silently stop)
  2. A GroupWidget with children exported to .m and re-imported loads all children correctly
  3. All existing dashboard scripts run without modification after infrastructure changes
  4. Previously saved JSON and .m dashboards load without errors or data loss
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Add ErrorFcn to DashboardEngine.LiveTimer (INFRA-01)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Extract normalizeToCell shared helper and refactor call sites (INFRA-03)
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Fix GroupWidget .m export children + full suite backward compatibility gate (INFRA-02, COMPAT-01..04)

### Phase 2: Collapsible Sections
**Goal**: Users can collapse GroupWidget sections to reclaim screen space, with the grid reflowing immediately and the expanded/collapsed state surviving save/load
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-07, LAYOUT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Collapsing a GroupWidget causes widgets below it to shift upward, filling the reclaimed space
  2. Expanding a collapsed GroupWidget pushes widgets below it downward to make room
  3. A tabbed GroupWidget's active tab is preserved after a JSON save/load round-trip
  4. Tab labels are legible in both light and dark themes without visual ambiguity
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Wire ReflowCallback into GroupWidget collapse/expand and inject via DashboardEngine (LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Test ActiveTab JSON round-trip and verify/fix tab contrast in all themes (LAYOUT-07, LAYOUT-08)

### Phase 3: Widget Info Tooltips
**Goal**: Users can view a widget's written description without leaving the dashboard, via an info icon in the widget header that opens a Markdown-rendered popup
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: INFO-01, INFO-02, INFO-03, INFO-04, INFO-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Any widget with a non-empty Description shows an info icon in its header; widgets without a Description do not
  2. Clicking the info icon opens a popup displaying the description text rendered as Markdown
  3. The popup can be dismissed by clicking outside it or pressing Escape
  4. All 20+ existing widget types show the info icon and popup without any per-widget code changes
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Test scaffold (TestInfoTooltip) + DashboardLayout info icon injection and popup methods (INFO-01, INFO-02, INFO-03, INFO-04, INFO-05)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Wire hFigure into DashboardLayout from DashboardEngine, add reflow popup guard, integration tests (INFO-01, INFO-02, INFO-03, INFO-04, INFO-05)

### Phase 4: Multi-Page Navigation
**Goal**: Users can organize a dashboard into multiple named pages, navigate between them via a page bar, and have the active page survive a save/load cycle
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04, LAYOUT-05, LAYOUT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A dashboard defined with multiple pages shows a navigation bar (toolbar buttons or tab strip) that switches the visible page
  2. Only the active page's widgets are rendered; widgets on other pages are hidden and do not consume render time
  3. After saving and reloading a multi-page dashboard, the same page is active as when it was saved
  4. Existing single-page dashboards open without a visible page bar and behave identically to before
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — DashboardPage class + TestDashboardMultiPage scaffold (LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04, LAYOUT-05, LAYOUT-06)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — DashboardEngine: Pages model, PageBar UI, switchPage, scoped onLiveTick (LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04, LAYOUT-06)
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — DashboardSerializer: multi-page JSON save/load + backward compat (LAYOUT-05, LAYOUT-03)

### Phase 5: Detachable Widgets
**Goal**: Users can pop any widget out as a standalone figure window that stays live-synced with the dashboard's data updates, without degrading dashboard refresh rate
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 4
**Requirements**: DETACH-01, DETACH-02, DETACH-03, DETACH-04, DETACH-05, DETACH-06, DETACH-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every widget shows a detach button in its header; clicking it opens the widget in a new MATLAB figure window
  2. The detached figure continues to update with new data on each dashboard timer tick
  3. Closing a detached figure window removes it from the engine's mirror registry; subsequent timer ticks produce no errors
  4. A detached FastSenseWidget has independent time axis zoom/pan (UseGlobalTime = false) without affecting the in-dashboard copy
  5. Detaching multiple widgets simultaneously does not measurably increase per-tick execution time in the dashboard
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — DetachedMirror class + TestDashboardDetach test scaffold (DETACH-01..07)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — DashboardLayout: DetachCallback property + addDetachButton() injection (DETACH-01)
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — DashboardEngine: DetachedMirrors registry, detachWidget(), removeDetached(), onLiveTick() mirror tail (DETACH-02..07)

### Phase 6: Serialization & Persistence
**Goal**: All new structures (multi-page layouts, collapsed state) survive both JSON and .m save/load round-trips, and detached widget state is correctly excluded from persistence
**Depends on**: Phase 4, Phase 5
**Requirements**: SERIAL-01, SERIAL-02, SERIAL-03, SERIAL-04, SERIAL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A multi-page dashboard saved as JSON and reloaded has the same pages, widgets, and active page as before saving
  2. A multi-page dashboard exported to .m and re-imported reconstructs all pages and widgets identically
  3. The collapsed/expanded state of every section is preserved after a save/load round-trip
  4. Saving and reloading a dashboard does not include detached window state (windows do not auto-reopen on load)
  5. A dashboard JSON created before this milestone loads without errors on the updated engine
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Multi-page JSON round-trip + detached exclusion + legacy backward compat tests (SERIAL-01, SERIAL-04, SERIAL-05)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Multi-page .m export/import round-trip + collapsed state persistence tests (SERIAL-02, SERIAL-03)
