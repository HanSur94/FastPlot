## Phase Details (Pending Milestone)

### Phase 1024: Fix companion app dark mode — CLOSED

**Status:** Closed 2026-05-08 via quick task [260508-d7k](./quick/260508-d7k-fix-companion-app-dark-mode-switching-th/).

**Root cause:** `applyThemeToChildren_` walker silently skipped widget classes without an explicit `case`. `uilistbox` (TagCatalogPane Row 7 — the tag list) was the visible casualty.

**Fix:** Added 8 widget cases to the walker (`ListBox`, `TextArea`, `CheckBox`, `NumericEditField`, `StateButton`, `ToggleButton`, `RadioButton`, `ButtonGroup`). Regression test asserts dark→light→dark flip across all classes.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.1 (2026-05-08)

### Phase 1025: FastSense hover crosshair + datatip

**Goal:** Add a vertical crosshair line that follows the mouse when hovering over a FastSense plot/widget, with a context datatip window showing the values of all lines at the hovered x position.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.2 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

### Phase 1026: Dashboard time slider preview

**Goal:** Fix the lower dashboard time slider so it shows a preview overlay of all graphed plot lines and detected events across the full time range. Currently the slider track is empty — investigate why the preview rendering isn't happening and restore it.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.3 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

### Phase 1027: Companion detachable log window

**Goal:** In the FastSense Companion app, make the log panel detachable into its own draggable, resizable window — same pop-out pattern as detachable widgets in the main dashboard.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.4 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

### Phase 1028: Tag update perf — MEX + SIMD

**Goal:** Profile and accelerate the tag update path (SensorTag/StateTag/MonitorTag/CompositeTag streaming + recompute). Identify hot spots and replace with C MEX kernels using SIMD (AVX2 / NEON) where it pays off, consistent with existing FastSense MEX patterns.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.5 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans
