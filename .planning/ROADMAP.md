- [x] **Phase 1011: Cleanup — collapse parallel hierarchy + delete legacy** — delete 8 legacy classes, rewrite golden test for new API, full suite green (completed 2026-04-17)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1004: Tag Foundation + Golden Test
**Goal**: Establish a parallel Tag hierarchy and an untouchable end-to-end regression guard so the rewrite has a stable safety net before any consumer touches Tag code.
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel hierarchy — legacy `Sensor`/`Threshold` untouched)
**Requirements**: TAG-01, TAG-02, TAG-03, TAG-04, TAG-05, TAG-06, TAG-07, META-01, META-02, META-03, META-04, MIGRATE-01, MIGRATE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can call `TagRegistry.register(key, tag)` / `get(key)` / `findByLabel('critical')` / `findByKind('sensor')` and observe correct results in a fresh session
  2. User can save a heterogeneous tag set to JSON and round-trip it back in any order (composite of composites included) via `TagRegistry.loadFromStructs` two-phase loader
  3. The Phase-0 golden integration test (current `Sensor` + `Threshold` + `CompositeThreshold` + `EventDetector` end-to-end) passes against the un-modified legacy code with the new Tag base in the path
  4. Every existing test in `tests/run_all_tests.m` still passes — Sensor/Threshold/StateChannel are byte-for-byte unchanged
  5. `Tag` base class exposes ≤6 abstract-by-convention methods (verified by counting `error('Tag:notImplemented', ...)` stubs)
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 1 (over-abstracted Tag):** Tag base class has ≤6 abstract methods; no `error('NotApplicable')` stub appears in any subclass written this phase
  - **Pitfall 5 (big-bang sequencing):** Phase touches ≤20 files (falsifiable file-touch budget); no edits to `Sensor.m`, `Threshold.m`, `StateChannel.m`, `CompositeThreshold.m`, `SensorRegistry.m`, `ThresholdRegistry.m`
  - **Pitfall 7 (TagRegistry collisions):** Collision strategy locked (hard error matching `ThresholdRegistry`); collision test green
  - **Pitfall 8 (serialization order):** Two-pass `loadFromStructs` shipped; loud error on missing references (no silent try/warning/skip); 3-deep composite-of-composite round-trip test green
  - **Pitfall 11 (test rewrite without golden):** Golden integration test exists and is checked in; documented as "do not rewrite without architectural review"
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1004-01-PLAN.md — Tag abstract base class + MockTag helper + tests (TAG-01, TAG-02, META-01, META-03, META-04)
- [x] 1004-02-PLAN.md — TagRegistry singleton + two-phase loader + tests (TAG-03, TAG-04, TAG-05, TAG-06, TAG-07, META-02)
- [x] 1004-03-PLAN.md — Golden integration test + file-touch budget verification (MIGRATE-01, MIGRATE-02)

### Phase 1005: SensorTag + StateTag (data carriers)
**Goal**: Port the raw-data half of the domain (`Sensor`'s data role and `StateChannel`'s ZOH lookup) into Tag subclasses so users can plot sensor and state data via the new `addTag()` API while every existing path keeps working.
**Depends on**: Phase 1004 (Tag base + TagRegistry)
**Requirements**: TAG-08, TAG-09, TAG-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can construct a `SensorTag('press_a')`, call `load(matFile)` and `toDisk(store)` and observe behavior feature-equivalent to the legacy `Sensor` raw-data API
  2. User can construct a `StateTag` with `(timestamps, states)` and `valueAt(t)` returns the correct ZOH lookup matching legacy `StateChannel` behavior
  3. User can call `FastSense.addTag(tag)` polymorphically — a SensorTag renders as a line, a StateTag renders as bands — without changing the underlying render code path
  4. Both `addSensor()` (legacy) and `addTag()` (new) work in the same FastSense instance — strangler-fig discipline preserved
  5. All existing tests still green; new `TestSensorTag` + `TestStateTag` + `TestFastSenseAddTag` smoke tests green
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 1:** No `isa(t, 'SensorTag')` switches inside `FastSense.addTag` — dispatch by `tag.getKind()` only
  - **Pitfall 5:** Phase touches ≤15 files; legacy `Sensor.m`/`StateChannel.m` not edited
  - **Pitfall 9 (MEX wrapping cost):** `SensorTag.getXY()` returns references not copies; benchmark vs. legacy `Sensor.getXY` ≤5% regression
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1005-01-PLAN.md — SensorTag composition wrapper + tests (TAG-08)
- [x] 1005-02-PLAN.md — StateTag with ZOH valueAt + tests (TAG-09)
- [x] 1005-03-PLAN.md — FastSense.addTag dispatcher + TagRegistry sensor/state kinds + Pitfall 9 benchmark (TAG-10)

### Phase 1006: MonitorTag (lazy, in-memory)
**Goal**: Replace the side-effect violation pipeline buried inside `Sensor.resolve()` with a first-class `MonitorTag` derived signal that is lazy by default, parent-driven invalidated, and supports debounce + hysteresis — without any disk persistence.
**Depends on**: Phase 1005 (SensorTag + StateTag for parent references)
**Requirements**: MONITOR-01, MONITOR-02, MONITOR-03, MONITOR-04, MONITOR-05, MONITOR-06, MONITOR-07, MONITOR-10, ALIGN-01, ALIGN-02, ALIGN-03, ALIGN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can construct `MonitorTag(key, parentSensorTag, conditionFn)` and `getXY()` returns a binary 0/1 time series produced via lazy memoized recompute
  2. When the parent SensorTag's `updateData()` is called, the dependent MonitorTag's cache is observably invalidated (next `getXY` recomputes)
  3. User can configure `MinDuration = 5` and observe that violations shorter than 5 seconds do not produce events (debounce works)
  4. User can configure separate alarm-on / alarm-off thresholds and observe no chatter at the boundary (hysteresis works)
  5. MonitorTag fires Events on 0→1 transitions with `TagKeys = {monitor.Key, parent.Key}` and the Event lands in the bound EventStore
  6. Aggregation against a child StateTag uses zero-order-hold only; pre-history grid points are dropped (no false "ok" padding)
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 2 (premature persistence):** Zero `FastSenseDataStore.storeMonitor` / `storeResolved` calls anywhere in MonitorTag code; "lazy-by-default, no persistence" documented in `MonitorTag.m` class header
  - **Pitfall 5:** Phase touches ≤12 files; legacy `Sensor.resolve()` still works untouched
  - **Pitfall 9:** Live-tick benchmark with one MonitorTag observed against legacy `Sensor.resolve` baseline → ≤10% regression at 12-widget tick
  - **MONITOR-10 explicit:** No per-sample callback APIs exposed (only `OnEventStart` / `OnEventEnd`)
  - **ALIGN-01 explicit:** No call to `interp1` with `'linear'` anywhere in `MonitorTag` aggregation code
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1006-01-PLAN.md — MonitorTag core (lazy memoize + parent observer hook on SensorTag/StateTag) + core tests (MONITOR-01, MONITOR-02, MONITOR-03, MONITOR-04, MONITOR-10, ALIGN-01, ALIGN-02, ALIGN-03, ALIGN-04)
- [x] 1006-02-PLAN.md — MinDuration debounce + hysteresis + Event emission via SensorName/ThresholdLabel carriers (MONITOR-05, MONITOR-06, MONITOR-07)
- [x] 1006-03-PLAN.md — FastSense.addTag 'monitor' case + TagRegistry round-trip + Pitfall 9 benchmark + phase-exit audit (MONITOR-02)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 1007: MonitorTag streaming + persistence
**Goal**: Add the two opt-in performance/persistence levers MonitorTag needs for live pipelines and very-long-history monitors — without compromising the lazy-by-default contract from Phase 1006.
**Depends on**: Phase 1006 (MonitorTag base behavior)
**Requirements**: MONITOR-08, MONITOR-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can call `monitor.appendData(newX, newY)` and the cached output extends incrementally without full recompute (verified by timing vs. full-recompute baseline)
  2. User can set `MonitorTag.Persist = true`, plot the monitor, restart MATLAB, reload the dashboard, and observe the previously-computed `(X, Y)` returns from disk via `FastSenseDataStore.loadMonitor` without recomputation
  3. With `Persist = false` (default), no SQLite writes occur — opt-in discipline holds
  4. `LiveEventPipeline` live-tick path uses `appendData` and produces correct events at >= the legacy throughput
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 2:** `Persist = false` is the documented default; `storeMonitor` only invoked when `Persist == true`
  - **Pitfall 5:** Phase touches ≤8 files (mostly `MonitorTag.m`, `FastSenseDataStore.m`, plus tests)
  - **Pitfall 9:** `appendData` benchmark vs. full recompute shows >5x speedup for 100k-sample tail append
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1007-01-PLAN.md — MonitorTag.appendData streaming + boundary-state continuity (MONITOR-08)
- [x] 1007-02-PLAN.md — MonitorTag Persist opt-in + FastSenseDataStore storeMonitor/loadMonitor/clearMonitor + quad-signature staleness (MONITOR-09)
- [x] 1007-03-PLAN.md — Pitfall 9 bench_monitortag_append + phase-exit audit + LEP-deferral SUMMARY (Success Criterion #4 -> Phase 1009)

### Phase 1008: CompositeTag
**Goal**: Aggregate one or more MonitorTags / CompositeTags into a single derived signal via merge-sort streaming, supporting AND / OR / MAJORITY / COUNT / WORST / SEVERITY / USER_FN — replacing the legacy `CompositeThreshold` for time-series aggregation.
**Depends on**: Phase 1006 (MonitorTag exists as a child type), Phase 1007 (streaming primitive available for live aggregation)
**Requirements**: COMPOSITE-01, COMPOSITE-02, COMPOSITE-03, COMPOSITE-04, COMPOSITE-05, COMPOSITE-06, COMPOSITE-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can construct a `CompositeTag` with `'and' | 'or' | 'majority' | 'count' | 'worst' | 'severity' | 'user_fn'` and observe correct aggregated output for a documented truth table
  2. User can call `addChild(monitorTagOrKey, 'Weight', 0.7)` accepting either a Tag handle or a string key resolved via TagRegistry
  3. Self-reference and deeper cycles (A → B → A) are rejected at `addChild` time with `CompositeTag:cycleDetected`
  4. `addChild(sensorTag)` is rejected — only MonitorTag and CompositeTag are valid children (no inherent ok/alarm semantics for raw signals or states)
  5. `valueAt(t)` returns the aggregated current value without materializing the full series (fast path for StatusWidget/GaugeWidget)
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 3 (memory blowup):** Bench with 8 children × 100k samples → peak RAM <50MB AND compute <200ms; no `union(X_1, ..., X_N)` followed by `interp1` per child anywhere in the implementation
  - **Pitfall 6 (semantics drift):** Truth tables for every `AggregateMode × {0, 1, NaN}` combination documented in the class header; `'majority'` rejects multi-state inputs at `addChild` time, not at `getXY` time
  - **Pitfall 8:** 3-deep composite-of-composite-of-composite round-trip test green
  - **ALIGN-04 explicit:** Test verifies AND-with-NaN → NaN, OR-with-NaN → other operand, MAX/WORST-with-NaN → ignore, COUNT ignores NaN
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1008-01-PLAN.md — CompositeTag class core + addChild with cycle detection + truth-table aggregator + basic unit tests (COMPOSITE-01..04, 07)
- [x] 1008-02-PLAN.md — Merge-sort getXY + ALIGN tests (NaN truth tables + pre-history drop) + 3-deep round-trip (COMPOSITE-05, 06, ALIGN-01..04)
- [x] 1008-03-PLAN.md — FastSense/TagRegistry integration + Pitfall 3 bench + phase audit (COMPOSITE-01, 05)

### Phase 1009: Consumer migration (one widget at a time)
**Goal**: Migrate every existing consumer of `Sensor` / `Threshold` / `StateChannel` / `CompositeThreshold` to the new Tag API — one widget per commit, each with green CI — so the legacy hierarchy can be deleted in Phase 1011 with zero references remaining.
**Depends on**: Phase 1008 (full Tag API surface available — Sensor/State/Monitor/Composite all working)
**Requirements**: (no exclusively-owned REQ-IDs — this is a structural integration phase that wires existing Tag REQs into existing consumers; MONITOR-05 auto-emit from Phase 1006 fully realized end-to-end here)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After each per-widget commit, `tests/run_all_tests.m` is green AND the Phase-0 golden integration test is green
  2. `FastSenseWidget` accepts a `Tag` (any kind) via a `Tag` property; legacy `Sensor` property still works through an `isa(input, 'Tag')` branch
  3. `MultiStatusWidget`, `IconCardWidget`, `EventTimelineWidget`, `SensorDetailPlot`, `DashboardWidget` base, `EventDetection` consumers all read MonitorTag outputs (auto-emit, status, severity) through the Tag API
  4. No new REQ-IDs are introduced — this phase is pure plumbing migration
  5. Every commit in this phase is independently revertable without breaking CI
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 5:** No legacy class is deleted in this phase; legacy `addSensor` / `addThreshold` paths remain alive in production
  - **Pitfall 9:** Live-tick benchmark with 12 migrated widgets ≤10% regression vs. baseline
  - **Pitfall 11:** Golden integration test untouched throughout this phase
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1009-01-PLAN.md — FastSense-layer consumers (FastSenseWidget + SensorDetailPlot) Tag migration + shared fixture factory
- [x] 1009-02-PLAN.md — Dashboard widgets (MultiStatusWidget + IconCardWidget + EventTimelineWidget) + DashboardWidget base Tag property + DashboardEngine tick dispatch + EventStore.getEventsForTag
- [x] 1009-03-PLAN.md — EventDetection consumers (EventDetector 2-arg overload + LiveEventPipeline MonitorTargets/appendData wire-up — realizes Phase 1007 SC#4)
- [x] 1009-04-PLAN.md — Pitfall 9 12-widget live-tick benchmark + phase-exit audit
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 1010: Event ↔ Tag binding + FastSense overlay
**Goal**: Replace the denormalized `SensorName`/`ThresholdLabel` strings on `Event` with a many-to-many binding via a separate `EventBinding` registry, and render bound events as toggleable round markers on FastSense plots — without polluting the existing line-rendering hot path.
**Depends on**: Phase 1009 (consumers fully on Tag API; EventDetection consumers ready to consume new Event shape)
**Requirements**: EVENT-01, EVENT-02, EVENT-03, EVENT-04, EVENT-05, EVENT-06, EVENT-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can query `EventStore.eventsForTag('pump_a_pressure_high')` and receive every event whose `TagKeys` cell contains that key (many-to-many works)
  2. `Event` carries no Tag handles and `Tag` carries no Event handles — verified by `save → clear classes → load` round-trip test
  3. User can call `tag.addManualEvent(t1, t2, 'spike', 'manual annotation')` and observe a new Event in the bound EventStore with `Category = 'manual_annotation'`
  4. User can plot a Tag in FastSense and observe round markers at every bound event timestamp, theme-colored by `Event.Severity`; setting `FastSense.ShowEventMarkers = false` removes them
  5. Render bench: a 12-line FastSense plot with zero attached events shows no measurable regression vs. pre-Phase-1010 baseline (separate render layer ships)
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 4 (Event ↔ Tag cycle):** Grep confirms zero `Event` properties of type `Tag`/`cell of Tag` and zero `Tag` properties of type `Event`/`cell of Event`; `save → clear classes → load` test green
  - **Pitfall 10 (render-path pollution):** New `renderEventLayer()` is a separate method called after `renderLines()`; single early-out at top if no events; no new conditionals in the line-rendering loop; 0-event render benchmark no regression
  - **Pitfall 5:** Phase touches ≤12 files (Event.m, EventBinding.m new, EventStore.m, EventViewer.m, FastSense.m, plus tests)
  - **EVENT-02 explicit:** Single-write-side rule — only `EventBinding.attach` mutates the relation; convenience wrappers on Event/Tag delegate
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1010-01-PLAN.md — Event.TagKeys + EventBinding singleton + EventStore auto-Id/eventsForTag migration + MonitorTag emission update (EVENT-01, EVENT-02, EVENT-03, EVENT-04, EVENT-05)
- [x] 1010-02-PLAN.md — Tag.addManualEvent + Tag.eventsAttached + FastSense renderEventLayer_ overlay (EVENT-06, EVENT-07)
- [x] 1010-03-PLAN.md — 0-event render benchmark + phase-exit Pitfall audit (all 7 EVENT gates)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 1011: Cleanup — collapse parallel hierarchy + delete legacy
**Goal**: Delete the eight legacy classes, fold any remaining adapter shims, rewrite the golden integration test for the new public API (`addSensor` → `addTag`), and ship a unified Tag-only domain model with a green test suite.
**Depends on**: Phase 1010 (every consumer fully on Tag API; no production reference to legacy classes remains)
**Requirements**: MIGRATE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The eight legacy classes are deleted from `libs/SensorThreshold/`: `Sensor.m`, `Threshold.m`, `ThresholdRule.m`, `CompositeThreshold.m`, `StateChannel.m`, `SensorRegistry.m`, `ThresholdRegistry.m`, `ExternalSensorRegistry.m`
  2. `grep -rE 'Sensor\(|Threshold\(|CompositeThreshold\(|StateChannel\(|SensorRegistry\.|ThresholdRegistry\.|ExternalSensorRegistry\.' libs/ tests/ examples/ benchmarks/` returns zero hits in production code (test fixtures explicitly migrated)
  3. The golden integration test is rewritten to call `FastSense.addTag` (not `addSensor`) and passes — proving end-to-end behavior preserved across the rewrite
  4. `tests/run_all_tests.m` is fully green; new tests for Tag/MonitorTag/CompositeTag/Event-Tag-binding all green
  5. `libs/SensorThreshold/` library file count is roughly neutral vs. milestone start (≈8 deleted, ≈7 added: Tag, TagRegistry, SensorTag, StateTag, MonitorTag, CompositeTag, EventBinding)
**Verification gates** (from PITFALLS.md):
  - **Pitfall 5:** This is the ONE phase in v2.0 where production deletions are allowed; no new feature code in this phase
  - **Pitfall 11:** Golden integration test rewrite is the ONLY allowed touch — must preserve assertion semantics; if behavior changed, that's a bug to investigate, not a test to update
  - **Pitfall 12 (feature creep):** Plan-write checked against A+B+C+E scope — no D/F/G features introduced under guise of cleanup
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 1011-01-PLAN.md — SensorTag data inlining + delete 8 legacy classes + private helpers + install.m update
- [x] 1011-02-PLAN.md — Delete legacy-only test files + benchmark files
- [x] 1011-03-PLAN.md — Remove legacy branches from 19 consumer production files
- [x] 1011-04-PLAN.md — Migrate 42 examples + 4 benchmarks + surviving test fixtures to Tag API
- [x] 1011-05-PLAN.md — Rewrite golden integration test + grep audit + phase-exit gate

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Mushroom Cards for Dashboard Engine (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Add Home Assistant-style Mushroom Card widgets to the dashboard engine — minimal, icon-driven cards with clean visual design for sensor status, controls, and quick glance data. Three new widget classes: IconCardWidget, ChipBarWidget, SparklineCardWidget, plus theme additions and full serializer/builder/detach integration.
**Requirements:** [MUSH-01: DashboardTheme InfoColor, MUSH-02: IconCardWidget, MUSH-03: ChipBarWidget, MUSH-04: SparklineCardWidget, MUSH-05: DashboardEngine type registration, MUSH-06: DashboardSerializer integration, MUSH-07: DetachedMirror + DashboardBuilder integration]
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 999.1-01-PLAN.md — DashboardTheme InfoColor + IconCardWidget implementation
- [ ] 999.1-02-PLAN.md — ChipBarWidget implementation
- [ ] 999.1-03-PLAN.md — SparklineCardWidget implementation

### Phase 999.3: Graph Data Export (.mat / .csv) (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Enable exporting any graph's underlying data as .mat or .csv files, so users can easily extract plotted data for further analysis in MATLAB or external tools.
**Requirements:** [EXPORT-01: CSV export with time + Y columns, EXPORT-02: MAT export with lines + thresholds structs, EXPORT-03: NaN-filled union for mismatched X arrays, EXPORT-04: Datetime ISO 8601 + datenum columns, EXPORT-05: Toolbar Export Data button, EXPORT-06: Empty plot error guard]

### Phase 1000: Dashboard Engine Performance Optimization Phase 2

**Goal:** Fix 6 identified performance bottlenecks in DashboardEngine: (1) FastSenseWidget.refresh() full teardown → incremental update reusing axes/FastSense, (2) broadcastTimeRange synchronous slider → debounced/coalesced updates, (3) All-page panel creation at startup → lazy page realization on first switchPage(), (4) getTimeRange full-array scan per widget per tick → cached min/max with incremental update, (5) switchPage synchronous realize → batched with drawnow, (6) Resize marks all dirty → debounced resize without dirty marking. Goal: 10-50x faster live ticks, 2-5x faster startup, smooth slider interactivity.
**Requirements**: [PERF2-01: Incremental FastSenseWidget refresh, PERF2-02: Debounced time slider broadcast, PERF2-03: Lazy page panel realization, PERF2-04: Cached widget time ranges, PERF2-05: Batched switchPage realize, PERF2-06: Debounced resize without dirty]
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

- [x] 1000-01-PLAN.md — Incremental FastSenseWidget refresh + cached time ranges
- [x] 1000-02-PLAN.md — Debounced slider broadcast + resize without dirty marking
- [x] 1000-03-PLAN.md — Lazy page panel realization + batched switchPage realize

### Phase 1001: First-Class Threshold Entities

**Goal:** Make thresholds independent, reusable entities with ThresholdRegistry and shared-reference semantics (TrendMiner-style). Breaking change: replace ThresholdRules/addThresholdRule with Threshold handle class + addThreshold across all libraries.
**Requirements**: [THR-01: Threshold handle class, THR-02: ThresholdRegistry singleton, THR-03: Sensor integration (addThreshold/removeThreshold), THR-04: Resolve adaptation, THR-05: Downstream consumer migration, THR-06: Test migration]
**Depends on:** Phase 1000
**Plans:** 6/6 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1001-01-PLAN.md — Threshold handle class + ThresholdRegistry singleton + tests
- [x] 1001-02-PLAN.md — Sensor.m refactor (Thresholds property, addThreshold, resolve adaptation) + sensor test migration
- [x] 1001-03-PLAN.md — Dashboard widgets, SensorRegistry display, loadModuleMetadata migration + widget tests
- [x] 1001-04-PLAN.md — EventDetection migration (IncrementalEventDetector, LiveEventPipeline, EventViewer) + EventDetection tests
- [x] 1001-05-PLAN.md — Gap closure: migrate 10 core sensor + consumer widget test files from addThresholdRule
- [x] 1001-06-PLAN.md — Gap closure: migrate 5 EventDetection test files from addThresholdRule

### Phase 1002: Direct Widget-Threshold Binding — StatusWidget, GaugeWidget, and other widgets can reference Threshold objects directly without requiring a Sensor. Enables standalone threshold-driven status indicators.

**Goal:** Add Threshold + Value/ValueFcn properties to StatusWidget, GaugeWidget, IconCardWidget, MultiStatusWidget, and ChipBarWidget so they can display threshold-driven status without requiring a Sensor object. Purely additive — existing Sensor-bound behavior unchanged.
**Requirements**: [THRBIND-01: StatusWidget + GaugeWidget threshold binding, THRBIND-02: IconCardWidget + MultiStatusWidget + ChipBarWidget threshold binding, THRBIND-03: Serialization round-trip for threshold-bound widgets, THRBIND-04: Backward compatibility, THRBIND-05: ValueFcn live tick support]
**Depends on:** Phase 1001
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1002-01-PLAN.md — StatusWidget + GaugeWidget threshold binding + serialization + tests
- [x] 1002-02-PLAN.md — IconCardWidget + MultiStatusWidget + ChipBarWidget threshold binding + serialization + tests

### Phase 1003: Composite Thresholds — CompositeThreshold class that aggregates child Threshold objects for hierarchical status. Component A is green only if children A.A and A.B are both green. Enables system health trees and nested status monitoring.

**Goal:** Create CompositeThreshold class that aggregates child Threshold objects with AND/OR/MAJORITY logic for hierarchical system health monitoring. Wire into all dashboard widgets (StatusWidget, GaugeWidget, IconCardWidget, MultiStatusWidget) with isa-guards and auto-expansion. Add serialization for save/load persistence.
**Requirements**: [COMP-01: CompositeThreshold inherits Threshold, COMP-02: AND/OR/MAJORITY aggregation, COMP-03: Nested composites, COMP-04: computeStatus method, COMP-05: addChild dual-input, COMP-06: Per-child ValueFcn/Value, COMP-07: Shared handle references, COMP-08: MultiStatusWidget expansion, COMP-09: ThresholdRegistry + serialization]
**Depends on:** Phase 1002
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1003-01-PLAN.md — CompositeThreshold class + TDD test suite (AND/OR/MAJORITY, addChild, computeStatus, nesting)
- [x] 1003-02-PLAN.md — Widget isa-guards (StatusWidget, GaugeWidget, IconCardWidget) + MultiStatusWidget composite expansion
- [x] 1003-03-PLAN.md — CompositeThreshold toStruct/fromStruct serialization + round-trip tests

### Phase 1004: Dashboard Image Export Button

**Goal:** Add an image export button to the dashboard toolbar that captures the entire dashboard layout as a single image (PNG/JPEG), enabling users to share or document their dashboard state with one click.
**Requirements**: [IMG-01: Image button present (label/tooltip/order), IMG-02: PNG export via Engine.exportImage, IMG-03: JPEG export via Engine.exportImage, IMG-04: Filename sanitization regex, IMG-05: Unknown format error ID, IMG-06: Write-failure error ID, IMG-07: uiputfile cancel no-op, IMG-08: Multi-page active-page capture, IMG-09: Live mode no-pause]
**Depends on:** Phase 1003
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1004-01-PLAN.md — DashboardEngine.exportImage delegate + RED/GREEN test scaffold (IMG-02..IMG-06)
- [x] 1004-02-PLAN.md — DashboardToolbar Image button + onImage/dispatch/defaultFilename (IMG-01, IMG-07)
- [x] 1004-03-PLAN.md — MATLAB suite extension + Octave parallel tests (IMG-01, IMG-07, IMG-08, IMG-09)

### Phase 1005: Expand CI coverage: MATLAB + Octave tests on macOS and Windows, MATLAB benchmark

**Goal:** Expand CI test coverage so the actual test suites (not just MEX build) run on macOS and Windows for both MATLAB and Octave, and run the performance benchmark under MATLAB too. Today Linux has full coverage; macOS/Windows only verify MEX compiles via `mex-build-macos` / `mex-build-windows`. This phase closes that gap.
**Requirements**: [COV-01: MATLAB tests on macOS ARM64, COV-02: MATLAB tests on Windows, COV-03: Octave tests on macOS ARM64, COV-04: Octave tests on Windows, COV-05: MATLAB benchmark job, COV-06: Reusable workflow extraction (conditional)]
**Depends on:** Phase 1004 (complete) + quick tasks 260416-j6e / jfo / jnp / k23 (all complete — provide the DRY'd reusable-workflow foundation and Octave 11.1.0 base)
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 1005 to break down)

### Phase 1006: Fix 137 MATLAB test failures surfaced by MATLAB-on-every-push CI enablement (7 categories from R2025b drift)

**Goal:** Fix the 137 MATLAB test failures surfaced when quick task 260416-j6e enabled MATLAB tests on every push/PR and removed `continue-on-error: true`. Pre-existing failures, now honest CI signal. Root-cause categorization in [.planning/debug/matlab-tests-failures-investigation.md](.planning/debug/matlab-tests-failures-investigation.md): 6 test-level categories + 1 infrastructure decision. Fixing A + B + F alone recovers ~95 tests (62%); A+B+C+D+E = ~92%.
**Requirements**: [MATLABFIX-A: mksqlite.mexa64 availability (~50 tests), MATLABFIX-B: testCase.TestData → properties migration (~41 tests), MATLABFIX-C: test-friend private access for 4 methods (~12 tests), MATLABFIX-D: R2025b API changes — table/OnOffSwitchState/jsondecode/fread (~18 tests), MATLABFIX-E: stale test expectations — KpiWidget/kpi-type rename/warning IDs/etc. (~21 tests), MATLABFIX-F: headless image export CI (4 tests), MATLABFIX-G: MATLAB version pinning policy (infrastructure decision — may reshape B/C/D)]
**Depends on:** Phase 1004 (complete) + quick tasks 260416-j6e / jfo / jnp / k23 (all complete — provide the CI foundation that surfaced these failures) + debug session `octave-cleanup-crash-investigation.md` (unrelated, already resolved) + debug session `matlab-tests-failures-investigation.md` (source of this phase's scope). **NOT** dependent on Phase 1005 (parallel work).
**Plans:** 4/4 plans executed

Plans:
- [x] 1006-01-PLAN.md — Pin MATLAB CI to R2020b in tests.yml + examples.yml (MATLABFIX-G; wave 1; reshapes scope of A/E/F)
- [x] 1006-02-PLAN.md — mksqlite diagnostic-first + fix branch (A/B/C) for TestMksqliteEdgeCases + TestMksqliteTypes (MATLABFIX-A; wave 2)
- [x] 1006-03-PLAN.md — Stale test expectations E1-E9 cluster + E10 grid-snap diagnostic+fix (MATLABFIX-E; wave 2)
- [x] 1006-04-PLAN.md — DashboardEngine.exportImage → exportgraphics() for headless MATLAB CI (MATLABFIX-F; wave 2)

### Phase 1012: Tag Pipeline — raw files to per-tag MAT via registry, batch and live

**Goal:** Deliver a MATLAB pipeline that ingests arbitrary delimited raw files (.csv/.txt/.dat) and emits per-tag .mat files keyed off TagRegistry, in two modes: BatchTagPipeline (synchronous one-shot) and LiveTagPipeline (timer-driven incremental append via modTime+lastIndex, mirroring MatFileDataSource). Outputs round-trip through the existing SensorTag.load() contract unchanged; MonitorTag/CompositeTag remain lazy per MONITOR-03. Binding lives on a new RawSource struct property on SensorTag + StateTag (Tag base untouched per Pitfall 1). Per-tag try/catch isolation + end-of-run TagPipeline:ingestFailed throw. Shared delimited-text parser (textscan-based, Octave 7+ compatible — no readtable/readmatrix).
**Requirements**: No exclusive REQ-IDs (v2.0 closed at Phase 1011 MIGRATE-03); scope captured by CONTEXT.md decisions D-01..D-19 (see 1012-CONTEXT.md).
**Depends on:** Phase 1011
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1012-01-PLAN.md — Wave 0 test scaffolds + synthetic raw-fixture generator (D-03)
- [x] 1012-02-PLAN.md — RawSource property on SensorTag + StateTag (D-05, D-06, D-11)
- [x] 1012-03-PLAN.md — Private parser helpers: readRawDelimited_, selectTimeAndValue_, writeTagMat_ (D-01, D-02, D-04, D-09, D-10, D-11, D-19 — 7 error IDs)
- [x] 1012-04-PLAN.md — BatchTagPipeline class + suite (D-02, D-07, D-08, D-09, D-10, D-12, D-15, D-16, D-17, D-18, D-19)
- [x] 1012-05-PLAN.md — LiveTagPipeline class + suite, modTime+lastIndex tick state machine (D-07, D-12, D-13, D-14, D-15, D-16, D-18, D-19)

### Phase 1013: Ship prebuilt MEX binaries for macOS, Windows, Linux so end users skip compilation

**Goal:** [To be planned]
**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 1012
**Plans:** 7/7 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 1013 to break down) (completed 2026-04-23)
