## Phase Details (v3.1 Plant Log Integration)

### Phase 1029: Plant Log Storage Foundation

**Goal:** Establish a separate `PlantLogStore` data model — parallel to `EventStore` but never merged into it — that holds imported plant-log entries, dedupes by timestamp + row-content hash, and exposes time-range queries plus a count API.

**Depends on:** Nothing (foundation phase for v3.1)
**Requirements:** PLOG-ST-01, PLOG-ST-02, PLOG-ST-03, PLOG-ST-04, PLOG-ST-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can construct an empty `PlantLogStore` and add entries that carry a timestamp, message text, and an arbitrary map of metadata column values; every stored entry returns its message and full metadata map on read.
  2. User can query the store by `[t0, t1]` and receive every entry whose timestamp lies in that range, and can query the total entry count independently.
  3. Re-adding rows with identical timestamp + row-content hash produces zero duplicate entries; the store's count stays stable across repeated identical adds.
  4. No code path causes a plant-log entry to appear in `EventStore.getEvents()` — `PlantLogStore` and `EventStore` are confirmed as fully independent stores in tests.
  5. `PlantLogStore:*` namespaced errors fire on invalid inputs, and pure-logic helpers (hashing, dedup, range filter) ship with unit tests that pass on both MATLAB and Octave.
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
- [x] 1029-01-entry-and-hash-PLAN.md — PlantLogEntry value class + djb2/computeRowHash private helpers + tests
- [x] 1029-02-store-PLAN.md — PlantLogStore handle class (reuses FastSense binary_search for ordered insert) + tests
- [x] 1029-03-install-and-smoke-PLAN.md — install.m wiring + end-to-end integration smoke test

### Phase 1030: CSV/XLSX Import + Mapping Dialog

**Goal:** Build the one-shot import pipeline — a CSV/XLSX reader that auto-detects timestamp and message columns, preserves remaining columns as metadata, and surfaces a uifigure mapping dialog with a 10-row preview so the user can override auto-detection before confirming.

**Depends on:** Phase 1029 (writes into `PlantLogStore`)
**Requirements:** PLOG-IM-01, PLOG-IM-02, PLOG-IM-03, PLOG-IM-04, PLOG-IM-05, PLOG-IM-06, PLOG-IM-07, PLOG-IM-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can point the importer at a `.csv` file and have every row become a plant-log entry; on MATLAB R2020b+, user can also import a `.xlsx` file (Octave XLSX support is gated on `usejava('jvm')` + `which xlsread` and tests skip cleanly when unavailable).
  2. On import, the system auto-selects the timestamp column as the first column whose values parse cleanly as dates/times, and auto-selects the message column as the first non-timestamp text column; every other column is preserved as metadata on each entry.
  3. After auto-detection, the user sees a modal uifigure mapping dialog listing the detected timestamp column, message column, metadata columns, and a 10-row preview of the parsed result — and can override the timestamp column, message column, or explicit timestamp format string before confirming.
  4. If no parseable timestamp column is detected, the user sees a non-blocking `uialert` and the dialog blocks confirmation until they pick a valid column manually.
  5. `PlantLogReader:*` / `PlantLogImportDialog:*` namespaced errors fire on malformed inputs, all dialog callbacks are wrapped in try/catch with non-blocking `uialert`, and unit tests for the pure auto-detect helper pass on both MATLAB and Octave.
**Plans:** TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 1031: Live Tail + Slider Preview Overlay

**Goal:** Add a periodic re-read live-tail timer that appends only newly-discovered rows to the store, and render every entry in the dashboard's bottom slider preview track as a black vertical line — visually distinct from existing sev1/2/3 markers — with a hover tooltip showing timestamp + message and a `MarkerPlantLog` theme token sourcing the color.

**Depends on:** Phase 1029 (store), Phase 1030 (re-uses reader for re-reads)
**Requirements:** PLOG-LT-01, PLOG-LT-02, PLOG-LT-03, PLOG-LT-04, PLOG-LT-05, PLOG-VIZ-01, PLOG-VIZ-02, PLOG-VIZ-06, PLOG-VIZ-08, PLOG-VIZ-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can enable live tail on a `PlantLogStore`, choose a re-read interval (default 5 s), and watch the slider preview gain black vertical lines as new rows appear in the source file without any duplicate entries across re-reads.
  2. When the user stops live tail (or closes the dashboard), the timer is stopped + deleted via the existing `Listeners_` + `stop(t); delete(t);` cleanup pattern; `timerfindall` shows no orphan timers and the cleanup path is exercised by tests.
  3. Whenever a `PlantLogStore` is attached to a dashboard, the bottom slider preview track shows a 1px, full-opacity black vertical line for every entry within the slider's visible range — the existing sev1/2/3 colored markers remain unchanged and the black plant-log lines are visually distinguishable from them.
  4. Hovering a plant-log line on the slider preview pops a small tooltip showing the entry's timestamp and message; new live-tail rows appear on the slider preview without a full dashboard re-render.
  5. The line color is sourced from a new theme token `MarkerPlantLog` (default black on both light and dark themes), parse errors during live-tail re-read surface via non-blocking `uialert`/`warning` without crashing the dashboard or stopping the timer, and the slider-overlay insertion path reuses the existing event-marker hook in `TimeRangeSelector` (verified against the sev1/2/3 marker code path).
**Plans:** TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 1032: Per-Widget Plant Log Overlay

**Goal:** Give every `FastSenseWidget` a `ShowPlantLog` toggle (default off) that, when enabled, draws black plant-log vertical lines on the widget's axes for entries within its current x-axis range, with a hover tooltip exposing timestamp + message + every metadata column value, and a button-bar icon to toggle the overlay per widget.

**Depends on:** Phase 1029 (store), Phase 1031 (live-refresh contract + theme token)
**Requirements:** PLOG-VIZ-03, PLOG-VIZ-04, PLOG-VIZ-05, PLOG-VIZ-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every `FastSenseWidget` exposes a `ShowPlantLog` boolean property that defaults to `false`; existing dashboards continue to render with no plant-log lines on any widget unless the user opts in.
  2. When a `PlantLogStore` is attached to the dashboard and a widget's `ShowPlantLog` is `true`, the widget's axes show a black vertical line at each entry timestamp within the widget's current x-axis range — color is sourced from the same `MarkerPlantLog` theme token introduced in Phase 1031.
  3. User can toggle `ShowPlantLog` per widget via an icon button in the widget button bar; the overlay appears or disappears immediately on toggle.
  4. Hovering a plant-log line on a widget pops a small tooltip showing the entry's timestamp, message, and every metadata column value; new live-tail rows appear on every `ShowPlantLog=true` widget without a full re-render (extending the Phase 1031 refresh contract to widget overlays).
  5. The widget-overlay insertion path reuses the existing tag-bound event-marker hook in `FastSenseWidget` (verified against the existing event-marker draw path) and the icon-button callback is wrapped in try/catch with non-blocking `uialert`.
**Plans:** TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 1033: Dashboard + Companion Integration & Serialization

**Goal:** Wire plant logs into the dashboard and Companion as a first-class feature — `DashboardEngine.attachPlantLog(path, opts)` / `detachPlantLog()`, JSON and `.m` serialization of source path + column mapping + live-tail interval + per-widget `ShowPlantLog`, re-import on load, and a `FastSenseCompanion` toolbar "Open Plant Log…" entry that attaches to every managed dashboard.

**Depends on:** Phase 1029 (store), Phase 1030 (importer), Phase 1031 (slider overlay + live tail), Phase 1032 (widget overlay)
**Requirements:** PLOG-INT-01, PLOG-INT-02, PLOG-INT-03, PLOG-INT-04, PLOG-INT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can call `engine.attachPlantLog(filePath, opts)` and immediately see the slider preview black-line overlay activate on that dashboard; `engine.detachPlantLog()` removes all slider and widget overlays and cleanly stops any active live tail (timer stopped + deleted, no orphans in `timerfindall`).
  2. User can click `FastSenseCompanion`'s toolbar "Open Plant Log…" entry, pick a file in the resulting dialog, and have the resulting `PlantLogStore` attach to every open `DashboardEngine` instance the Companion is managing.
  3. Saving a dashboard via `DashboardSerializer` (both JSON and `.m` export) writes the plant-log source path, the column mapping (timestamp/message/metadata + explicit format if overridden), the live-tail interval, and each widget's `ShowPlantLog` flag — but does NOT serialize the imported entries themselves.
  4. Loading a serialized dashboard re-imports the plant log from the saved source path using the saved column mapping, restores each widget's `ShowPlantLog` state, and the slider overlay reappears with the freshly-imported entries; existing v1.0–v3.0 serialized dashboards (with no plant-log section) continue to load without error.
  5. All new public APIs raise `PlantLogStore:*` / `PlantLogReader:*` namespaced errors on invalid inputs, every Companion toolbar callback is wrapped in try/catch with non-blocking `uialert`, and the round-trip "attach → save → load → re-attach" path is covered by tests that pass on both MATLAB and Octave (with XLSX gated where necessary).
**Plans:** TBD
**UI hint**: yes
