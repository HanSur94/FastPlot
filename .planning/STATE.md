# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** Users can organize complex dashboards into navigable sections and pop out any widget for detailed analysis without losing the dashboard context.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — widget-info-tooltips

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- — see PROJECT.md Key Decisions for pending architectural choices (EngineRef pattern, info tooltip click mechanism, DetachedMirror timer strategy)
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-hardening]: ErrorFcn added to DashboardEngine.LiveTimer using onLiveTimerError; timer restart guarded by IsLive flag
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-hardening]: normalizeToCell placed in libs/Dashboard/private/ per INFRA-03; test uses indirect verification via DashboardSerializer.loadJSON due to MATLAB private/ path restrictions
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-hardening]: GroupWidget children emitted via constructors not d.addWidget() to avoid adding them as top-level widgets; groupCount threaded through emitChildWidget to prevent variable name collisions
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-hardening]: Test triggers ErrorFcn indirectly via a throwing TimerFcn rather than calling private onLiveTimerError directly
- [Phase 02-collapsible-sections]: All 6 DashboardTheme presets pass tab contrast checks (delta >= 0.05); no DashboardTheme.m changes needed for LAYOUT-08
- [Phase 02-collapsible-sections]: Used EngineRef callback pattern (lambda injection) for ReflowCallback, consistent with Phase 1 LiveTimer ErrorFcn pattern
- [Phase 02-collapsible-sections]: reflowAfterCollapse() guards on hFigure validity to avoid errors when no figure is rendered
- [Phase 03-widget-info-tooltips]: openInfoPopup/closeInfoPopup made public for testability; hFigure/hInfoPopup as public properties for test injection and state verification
- [Phase 03-widget-info-tooltips]: closeInfoPopup guards callback restore with wasOpen flag to prevent overwriting prior figure callbacks during guard call at start of openInfoPopup

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Multi-Page): DashboardEngine render guard interaction with panel-visibility-based page switching needs architecture review before implementation starts
- Phase 5 (Detachable): `cloneForDetach()` for FastSenseWidget and RawAxesWidget involves non-serializable live references — enumerate affected widget types at phase start
